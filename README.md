# rusty_bot

Rust implementation of my [Pyt\<wh>orstBot](https://github.com/TheFinnishArmy/Pyt-wh-orstBot)
Most importantly a bot to fetch ability info from the overwatch wiki and then parse it into a nice embed

The bot expects a discord bot token in a file called "token.txt", otherwise there's no configuration options.
